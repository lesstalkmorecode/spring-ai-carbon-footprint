I want to estimate the overall carbon emissions (CO2 footprint) for a vehicle based on the following static data.

Vehicle Data:
    - Vehicle Model: {vehicleModel}
    - Vehicle Type: {vehicleType}
    - Fuel Type: {fuelType}
    - Load: {load} kg
    - Braking Events: {brakingEvents}
    - Vehicle Speed: {vehicleSpeed} km/h
    - Tirematics Data: {tirematicsDataList}

Use basic Carbon Footprint Formula with inputs: Vehicle Model, Vehicle Type, Fuel Type, Load, Braking Events, Vehicle Speed, use all the elements in Tirematics Data
Show me the input parameters you are using for each result and make this calculation 50 times, remove outliers and calculate mean carbon footprint value as a final output.
